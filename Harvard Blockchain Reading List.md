### Future of Blockchain

The future of blockchains centers around scalability advancements, embracing modular design, leveraging rollups, and fostering cross-rollup solutions.

For an overview of Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap, see this:
- [Ethereum's Rollup-centric Roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)

For an overview of projects, see [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary). The main two rollups to pay attention to are:
- [Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/intro/)
- [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/)

### Solidity and Smart Contracts

Solidity is the most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. It is a statically-typed, contract-oriented, high-level language. It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. There are lots of great resources for learning about Solidity. Here are some of our favorites:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/) - The official documentation for Solidity.
- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) - An interactive tutorial for learning Solidity.
- [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) - A collection of Solidity examples.
